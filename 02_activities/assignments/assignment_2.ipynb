    "\n",
    "The solution works effectively because it uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal to explore all paths from the root of the tree to its leaves in a systematic and complete manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why I think the solution is correct and efficient:\n",
    "- The algorithm starts with the root and explores all possible paths iteratively.\n",
    "- For each node, it tracks:\n",
    "    + The path to reach that node.\n",
    "    + Whether it is a leaf (if so, the path is added to the result).\n",
    "    + Its children (adding them to the queue along with the updated path).\n",
    "- BFS ensures that every path from the root to a leaf is covered without missing any nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works because it satisfies the problem requirements by:\n",
    "- Exploring all paths: The queue systematically processes all nodes, ensuring no paths are skipped.\n",
    "- Identifying leaf nodes accurately: By checking for not node.left and not node.right, the solution captures only root-to-leaf paths.\n",
    "- Maintaining paths dynamically: By passing updated paths as part of the queue entries, the solution ensures that every path is built incrementally and correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of This Solution\n",
    "- Iterative BFS: Avoids recursion and stack limitations.\n",
    "- Complete: Guarantees that all root-to-leaf paths are found.\n",
    "- Simple and Clean: The logic is straightforward, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Readability:**\n",
    "    - The code is clean and easy to follow, with meaningful variable names (`node`, `path`, `queue`) and a clear separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient Queue Management:**\n",
    "    - Using a `deque` for the queue ensures efficient operations with `O(1)` append and pop operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses of the Solution\n",
    "1. **Path Building Overhead:**\n",
    "    - The code uses `path + [node.val]` to build new paths when enqueueing child nodes.\n",
    "    - This involves creating a new list every time a child node is processed, which introduces overhead, especially for deeper trees.\n",
    "    - Impact: For deeper trees, this list concatenation increases the time complexity for building paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Space Usage:**\n",
    "    - The space complexity for storing paths in the result list can grow large, particularly for unbalanced or deep trees.\n",
    "    - This is inherent to the problem but should be noted for very large trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limited Scalability for Extremely Large Trees:**\n",
    "    - While the BFS approach avoids recursion depth issues, it still requires memory for the queue and path storage.\n",

    "#### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
    "1. Path Construction Optimization\n",
    "    - Original code creates a new list every time a child is processed, which is less efficient for large or deep trees.\n",
    "        + line 27: `queue.append((node.left, path + [node.left.val]))`\n",
    "        + line 29: `queue.append((node.right, path + [node.left.val]))`\n",
    "    - Adjusted code constructes the paths only once per node (with `current_path`) and reused, reducing redundant operations.\n",
    "        + line 20: `current_path = path + [node.val]`\n",
    "        + line 28: `queue.append((node.left, current_path))`\n",
    "        + line 30: `queue.append((node.right, current_path))`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Minor Structural Cleanup in line 16: from `queue = deque([(root, [root.val])])` to `queue = deque([(root, [])])`\n",
    "    - The adjusted version uses an empty list `[]` for the initial path instead of `[root.val]`, keeping path construction consistent and always appended inside the loop.\n",
    "    - The `current_path` is explicitly created once per iteration, improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why These Changes Matter\n",
    "- Efficiency: Optimizing path creation avoids unnecessary list copying, especially for large or deep trees.\n",

    "I began with Approach 1 (Set Difference), which was intuitive and straightforward. Using Python's set operations, I compared a complete range to the input. While it was clean and easy to implement, initial tests revealed mistakes, particularly with edge cases. Although fixing these helped deepen my understanding, I realized this approach becomes inefficient for large ranges due to its O(max_value + n + k log k) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I tackled Approach 2 (Boolean Array) to optimize performance. This approach marked seen numbers in a boolean array and identified missing values through a simple iteration. With a time complexity of O(max_value + n), this was the most efficient solution, particularly for large datasets. This process reinforced the importance of selecting the right data structure for performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I developed Approach 3 (Sort + Two Pointers) to explain an alternative. Sorting the input and comparing it to the range allowed me to explicitly handle duplicates, making it a practical middle-ground solution. This assignment enhanced my understanding of algorithms, trade-offs, and adapting solutions to meet different requirements.\n",

    "Collaborating with my partner on this solution was a constructive experience. Their implementation effectively used Breadth-First Search (BFS) to systematically traverse the binary tree and capture all root-to-leaf paths. Their explanation of BFS mechanics and its iterative approach was clear and insightful. Additionally, their emphasis on correctness and efficient queue management provided a solid foundation for understanding the solution's strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, through reviewing the solution, I identified a few areas for optimization. The original code's path construction introduced overhead, especially for deep or unbalanced trees. Adjusting this to construct paths once per node and reusing them improved efficiency. A minor structural cleanup in queue initialization also made path handling more consistent and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses of the solution, such as space usage and scalability challenges for large or deep trees, were inherent to BFS but are worth noting. Including these considerations highlighted the importance of choosing the right algorithm based on the tree's characteristics. Furthermore, documenting edge cases and refining explanations strengthened the solution’s presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this collaboration emphasized the value of iterative feedback and showcased how constructive critique and small adjustments can enhance both the solution's clarity and performance.\n",
